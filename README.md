# Intern Log Book

A simple digital logbook for interns to track their daily activities, presented with an interactive, book-like interface.

## About This Project

This application provides an intuitive way for interns to document their work and progress in a digital format that mimics a real book.

It's a full-stack web application built with PHP for the back-end and modern front-end technologies like Tailwind CSS and Alpine.js for a clean and interactive user experience. The page-turning effect is created using turn.js.
